# CSV to qrcodedynamic.com

Upload a CSV file to create dynamic links and QR codes via qrcodedynamic.com.

## Missing Features

**Stop after first failure**
This is to prevent creating a bunch of junk requests.

**Ability to handle already-created links**
If a URL already exists, it'll fail to create... but! It won't provide an ID. And there is no way to get the ID than to download the full list of Links.
